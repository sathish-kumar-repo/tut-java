         * The first 32 characters in the ASCII-table
         * are unprintable control codes and are used to control peripherals such as
         * printers.
         * 
         * Codes 32-127 are common for all the different variations of the ASCII table,
         * they are
         * called printable characters, represent letters, digits, punctuation marks,
         * and a few miscellaneous symbols.
